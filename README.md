# Frontend Assessment

## Comments

<!--
- In order to replicate the frontend application as close as possible, many paddings/margins were modified more than I'd prefer, in most cases. (ex. src/components/profile.css => '.profileDetailsExpanded' margin value) -->

- Some of the css styles appear different in later parts of the assessment
- This assessment was honestly quite interesting and fun!

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
